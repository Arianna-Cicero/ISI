# ✈️ Aviation Data Warehouse - ETL Project

*An end-to-end data engineering solution for airline business intelligence*

## 📊 Project Overview

This comprehensive data warehouse project implements a complete ETL pipeline for aviation data analysis. Designed to transform raw operational data into actionable business insights, supporting critical decision-making in airline operations and customer management.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Dimensional Model
- **Fact Tables**: `F_Flight` (operational metrics), `F_Booking` (commercial metrics)
- **Dimension Tables**: 
  - `D_Date` (temporal analysis)
  - `D_Passenger` (customer demographics)
  - `D_Flight` (route and schedule details)
  - `D_Airport` (location and infrastructure)
  - `D_Airline` (carrier information)
  - `D_Airplane` (aircraft specifications)

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Dual ETL Approach
| **KNIME** | **Pentaho Data Integration** |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| Modular node-based workflow | Stream-based transformation |
| 15+ nodes for date dimension | ~5 steps for equivalent logic |
| Visual debugging interface | Complex flow coordination |

### Key Features
- **Temporal Intelligence**: Advanced date dimension with seasonal analysis
- **Operational Metrics**: Flight duration, delays, and performance indicators
- **Data Quality**: Comprehensive cleaning and validation workflows
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handles large-volume aviation data

## 🚀 ETL Processes

### Core Workflows
1. **Dimension Loading**
   - Date dimension generation with seasonal attributes
   - Passenger data enrichment and cleaning
   - Airport and airline reference data integration

2. **Fact Table Processing**
   - Flight operations fact calculation
   - Booking and reservation analytics
   - Multi-dimensional joins and key management

### Advanced Transformations
- JavaScript-based date calculations
- Regex pattern matching for data validation
- Complex merge operations across multiple sources
- Performance-optimized lookup strategies

## 💡 Challenges & Solutions

### Data Flow Management
- **Challenge**: Coordinating multiple inputs/outputs in complex schemas
- **Solution**: Strategic use of TXT dumps for intermediate validation

### Dimensional Integration
- **Challenge**: Simultaneous multi-dimension lookups in F_Flight
- **Solution**: Careful operation sequencing and surrogate key management

### Performance Optimization
- **Challenge**: Large-volume joins and lookup efficiency
- **Solution**: Targeted filtering and process optimization

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
- KNIME Analytics Platform OR Pentaho Data Integration
- Database connection (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- Sample aviation datasets

### Quick Start
1. Clone repository
2. Configure database connections
3. Execute dimension loading workflows
4. Run fact table population jobs
5. Validate data quality metrics

## 📊 Business Impact

This data warehouse enables:
- **Operational Efficiency**: Flight performance and delay analysis
